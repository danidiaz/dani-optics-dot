# optics-dot

Use `OverloadedRecordDot` for nested field access and modification using optics from the ["optics-core"](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optics-core) package.

See the Haddocks for the `Optics.Dot` module for an example.

(Note that "optics-core" already provides syntactic sugar for field lenses in the [`Optics.Label`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optics-core-0.4.1.1/docs/Optics-Label.html) module. It's based on [`OverloadedLabels`](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/exts/overloaded_labels.html) instead of [`OverloadedRecordDot`](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/exts/overloaded_record_dot.html).)
